CloudOS
-------

This is a prototype kernel that is bootable by qemu. Its eventual purpose is to
run CloudABI[0] binaries, including the ability to suspend, freeze, serialize,
deserialize, thaw and resume CloudABI binaries. However, it's still far from
that goal.

To run the tests, compile it with a native (non-cross) compiler:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
  make
  make test

To compile the kernel, first build and install Binutils with '--target
i686-elf', then build and install Clang SVN with '-DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86'.
Then, in the 'bin' directory where both are installed, run:

  ln -s i686-elf-ar i686-unknown-cloudabi-ar
  ln -s i686-elf-ld i686-unknown-cloudabi-ld
  ln -s clang i686-unknown-cloudabi-cc
  ln -s clang++ i686-unknown-cloudabi-c++

Then, use the CloudABI toolchain file to set up your build directory:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/Toolchain-i686-cloudabi.cmake ..
  make

There is a 'boot' target that will run the kernel inside qemu:

  make boot

Good luck and have fun!
